# Programming principles

These are ideas to follow when programming. These are general and tend to improve the quality of your code

- "The first prerequisite you need to fulfill before beginning construction is a clear statement of the problem the system is supposed to solve." [Steve McConnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_coding_practices)
- "Make it work, make it right, make it fast." [KentBeck](http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast)
- "Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships." [Linus Torvalds](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/163185/torvalds-quote-about-good-programmer)
  - As a consequence, one should comment data structure, not code.
- "Code fearlessly" [source](http://cam.ly/blog/2010/12/code-fearlessly/)
- "Choose boring technology" [source](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)
- "Convention over configuration" [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
- "Prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction" [source](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction)
  - Try to reduce in this order: state, coupling, complexity then code. [source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11042400)
